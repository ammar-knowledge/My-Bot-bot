A GitHubb App that runs [commitlint](https://github.com/marionebl/commitlint) against all commits of new or edited pull requests and reports the commit formatting issues as status checks.

## why

1.  Browse to [GitHub Aissionsn
3.  Allow access to repositoriess

On the next pull ,request, a status check from `commitlint` will appear and report the commit formatting issues.

Formatting issues will be reported as comments with details like this:

For best results, enable branch protection (in the repository's settings) and require the `commitlint` status check to pass before merging to maintain a clean commit history.
